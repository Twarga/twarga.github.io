## Cybersecurity Roadmap: Your Path to Success in 2025

---


### **Who Is This Guide For?**

1. **Complete Beginners**: Switching from non-IT jobs or starting cybersecurity as a first career.
2. **IT Professionals**: Transitioning from another IT role or with existing IT knowledge.

Depending on your background, your starting point might differ, so let’s outline the steps for each group.

---

### **Step 1: Learn IT Basics**

If you’re new to IT, understanding how computers and hardware work is essential. Start with the **CompTIA A+ certification** to build foundational knowledge. While the exam requires a voucher, you can study for free using **Professor Messer’s A+ training course on YouTube**.

If budget constraints are an issue, focus on mastering the content without taking the exam initially.

### **Step 2: Master Core Skills**

Before specializing in cybersecurity, develop these core skills:

#### **1. Linux**

Linux is the backbone of cybersecurity. Here are some beginner-friendly, free resources:

- **Linux Journey**: Covers basic to advanced Linux concepts.
- **PwnCollege**: Offers a free course introducing Linux command-line skills.

**Pro Tip**: Consider using Linux as your daily operating system to gain hands-on experience. For certifications, explore:

- **CompTIA Linux+**
- **LPIC-1 and LPIC-2** (Linux Foundation)

#### **2. Networking**

Understanding networking is crucial for cybersecurity. Start with:

- **Cisco Networking Basics (NetAcad)**: A free course teaching fundamental concepts like subnetting, protocols, and network types. It also offers a Cisco badge for your resume.

Once you’re ready, aim for certifications like:

- **CCNA** (Cisco Certified Network Associate)
- **CompTIA Network+**

#### **3. Windows and Windows Server**

Knowing how Windows operates, especially in enterprise environments, is vital. Focus on:

- **Windows Client Basics**: TryHackMe offers a free three-part series.
- **Windows Server and Active Directory**: Check out the **IT Flee YouTube channel** for detailed tutorials.

#### **4. Programming**

Learn programming to automate tasks, analyze data, and write security tools. Choose between two paths:

**Path 1: Comprehensive Approach**

- Study computer architecture, assembly language, and C programming.
- Learn Python using the free book **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**.

**Path 2: Quick Start**

- Focus on Python first, then pick up **Bash scripting** (Linux) and **PowerShell** (Windows).

### **Step 3: Enter Cybersecurity**

Start with the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, a must-have for entry-level roles. Two ways to prepare:

1. **Foundation Route**: Begin with Google’s free cybersecurity course on Coursera. You can:

   - Learn during their free 7-day trial.
   - Optionally, pay for a certificate (\$49/month) for added credibility.

2. **Fast Track**: Use **Professor Messer’s free Security+ course on YouTube** and buy the exam voucher when ready.

### **Step 4: Choose Your Path**

Cybersecurity offers two main career paths:

#### **1. Defensive Security (Blue Team)**

- Focus on protecting systems, monitoring for threats, and responding to incidents.
- Start as a SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst and progress to roles like Cybersecurity Engineer.

**Certifications**:

- **CompTIA CySA+**
- **CISSP** (for senior roles)

#### **2. Offensive Security (Red Team)**

- Specialize in ethical hacking to identify vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
- Begin as a Junior Penetration Tester and advance to roles like Red Team Lead.

**Certifications**:

- **CompTIA PenTest+**
- **OSCP** (advanced)

**Quick Advice**: Blue Team roles, especially SOC Analyst positions, have more job openings and quicker hiring paths compared to Red Team roles.

---

### **Step 5: Gain Hands-On Experience**

Practice is key in cybersecurity. Use platforms like:

- **TryHackMe**: Beginner-friendly and scenario-based labs.
- **Hack The Box**: For more advanced challenges.
- Search YouTube for real-world lab tutorials.

---

### **Conclusion**

Cybersecurity isn’t just a job; it’s a journey. Start with the basics, build core skills, and choose the path that excites you most. Whether you’re defending systems or testing them, the opportunities in cybersecurity are endless.
